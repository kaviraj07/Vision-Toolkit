Gaussian Blur applies a blur effect to the image, Laplacian applies a sharpening effect, and Edge Detection applies both Gaussian Blur and Laplacian filters.")

It is visually useful to determine the dominant colour of the picture and how the colours are distributed. Applications of color histograms include image retrieval, object recognition, and image indexing. It is also used in video analysis to detect changes in the scene.")
